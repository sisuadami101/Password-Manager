## 🔑 How Passwords Are Saved

- All saved passwords are stored inside **localStorage** under key: `pm_vault_v1`
- Data is not encrypted (because offline use)
- You can clear data anytime from settings or browser storage
- No data leaves your device

---

## ⚠️ Security Notes

🔸 This is a **client-side only vault** (localStorage)  
🔸 Do not use for highly sensitive corporate passwords  
🔸 For personal offline use, portable devices, USB portable app ✅  
🔸 You control 100% of the data — nothing is uploaded anywhere
